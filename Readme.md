# A Multi-modal Visual Emotion Recognition Method
The goal of this project is to recognise emotions in most situations. For this, four kinds of data are taken: face, posture, body and context/environment features. Each of these are processed independently and then combined with a merging method called EmbraceNet+, wich is an extention of the [EmbraceNet](https://github.com/idearibosome/embracenet).

## Getting proper Data
![alt text](https://github.com/juan1t0/multimodalDLforER/blob/master/figures/pre-pross.png)
The used data are shared [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JAGejLFaymrIsq44icV42IdaAdydSdk9/view?usp=sharing), this zip contains all the data for each modality in numpy array format.

This dataset is acquire form the original [EMOTIC dataset](http://sunai.uoc.edu/emotic/download.html).

## Execution
Currently, only the execution with a [notebook](https://github.com/juan1t0/multimodalDLforER/blob/master/EmbraeNet_Plus.ipynb) is available.
